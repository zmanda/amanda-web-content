After 2.4.0, the structure of the directory holding the index files was changed to have three levels instead of being flat. This greatly reduces the number of files in a given directory, which was a problem for some systems.
The new layout is:

[indexdir]/hostname/filesystem/YYYYMMDD_L.gz
where hostname and filesystem are "sanitized" versions of the names from disklist, i.e. '/' characters are converted to '_' and so on. This new naming convention matches the one used for the text formatted database.
A script is available to convert the flat directory structure to the new layout: [msg00428.html](../msg00428)
